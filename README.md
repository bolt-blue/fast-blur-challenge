# Fast Blur Challenge

Implement the `blur()` function in `blur.c`. Make it as fast as possible.

## Rules

1. 

## DEADLINE

18 Jan 17:00pm UTC.
(Temporarily subject to alteration.)

## Build

```sh
$ make [release]
$ make debug
$ make -B release
```

Using `-B` will be necessary to force a rebuild if switching between `release`
and `debug` when no changes have been made to `filter.c|h` since the last build.
